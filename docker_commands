$ docker pull {image}
: To fetch {image} from the Docker registry and saves it to your system.
(e.g., $ docker pull busybox)

$ docker images
: To see a list of all images on your system.

$ docker run
: To run a docker container based on these images (e.g., $ docker run busybox)

When we run docker run busybox, we didn't provide a command, 
so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited.

$ docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"

$ docker ps
: To show you all containers that are currently running.

$ docker ps -a
: To see a list of all containers that you ran.

$ docker run -it {image} sh
: To run more than just one command in a container.
(e.g., $ docker run -it busybox sh)

$ ctrl + c 
: To stop the container

/ # exit
: To detatch from the container and stops it once you have attached 
to a Docker Container via a CMD console

$ docker run --help
: To see a list of all flags it supports.

$ docker rm {containerID1 containerID2 ...}
: To clean up containers once you are done with them.
(e.g., $ docker rm 305297d7a235 ff0a5c3750b9)

$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
: To delete all containers that have a status of exited.
(the -q flag, only returns the numeric IDs 
and -f filters output based on conditions provided.)

$ docker run --rm {image}
: To automatically delete the container once it's exited
(e.g., $ docker run --rm busybox echo "hello world")

$ docker container prune
: (FOR LATER VERIONS OF DOCKER, 
to delete all container that have a status of exited.)

$ docker rmi {image}
: To delete images that you no longer need ($ docker rmi busybox)
