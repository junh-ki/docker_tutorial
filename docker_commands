# Basic Commands

$ docker search {image}
: To search for images on Docker Hub (The Docker Registry) 
directly from the command line. ($ docker search busybox)

$ docker pull {image}
: To fetch {image} from the Docker registry and saves it to your system.
(e.g., $ docker pull busybox)

$ docker images
: To see a list of all images on your system.

$ docker run {image}
: To run a docker container based on these images (e.g., $ docker run busybox)

When we run docker run busybox, we didn't provide a command, 
so the container booted up, ran an empty command and then exited.

$ docker run busybox echo "hello from busybox"

$ docker ps
: To show you all containers that are currently running.

$ docker ps -a
: To see a list of all containers that you ran.

$ docker run -it {image} sh
: To run more than just one command in a container.
(e.g., $ docker run -it busybox sh)

$ docker stop {containerID1 containerID2 ...}
: To stop containers that are running.
(e.g., docker stop 7d2da43a399e)

$ ctrl + c 
: To escape the container

/ # exit
: To detatch from the container and stops it once you have attached 
to a Docker Container via a CMD console

$ docker run --help
: To see a list of all flags it supports.

$ docker rm {containerID1 containerID2 ...}
: To clean up containers once you are done with them.
(e.g., $ docker rm 305297d7a235 ff0a5c3750b9)

$ docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)
: To delete all containers that have a status of exited.
(the -q flag, only returns the numeric IDs 
and -f filters output based on conditions provided.)

$ docker run --rm {image}
: To automatically delete the container once it's exited
(e.g., $ docker run --rm busybox echo "hello world")

$ docker container prune
: (FOR LATER VERIONS OF DOCKER, 
to delete all container that have a status of exited.)

$ docker rmi {image}
: To delete images that you no longer need ($ docker rmi busybox)



# Static Sites (How to run a webserver inside a Docker image)

- Download and run the static sites image
$ docker run --rm prakhar1989/static-site

- Stop the container to get to know how to see the website, what port is it 
running on, how do you access the container directly from your host machine
(The client is not exposing any ports)
Ctrl + c

- Re-run the docker run command to publish ports and Detach your terminal 
so that your terminal is not attached to the running container - Detached Mode/
(This way, you can happily close your terminal and keep the container running.)
(-d: detach your terminal / -p: publish all exposed ports to random ports /
--name: a name you want to give to the image that you are publishing ports to)
$ docker run -d -P --name static-site prakhar1989/static-site

- See and confirm the ports that are published to the static-site image
$ docker port static-site

- You can open http://localhost:{port number}
(e.g., http://localhost:32773/) - go with 80/tcp

- You can also specify a custom port to which the client will forward connections 
to the container
$ docker run -p 8888:80 prakhar1989/static-site

- To open static-site with the custom port, you need to know your Docker host's
IP address. To find out your Docker host's IP address
$ ip a

- Navigate to 3: docker0: ...> inet 172.17.0.1 / this is the IP address.

- You can not open static-site with the custom port(8888)
(e.g., http://172.17.0.1:8888/)

- To stop a detached container
$ docker stop {containerID}
(e.g., $ docker stop static-site / $ docker stop 9bc51c451b46)



# Creating your own Docker image

- Clone the pre-made git repo (a Flask web app that displays a random car .gif)
(e.g., $ git clone https://github.com/prakhar1989/docker-curriculum.git)

- Navigate to the repo folder
(e.g., $ cd docker-curriculum/flask-app)

- Make a new Dockerfile from scratch (plain txt file with the name "Dockerfile")
:
-----------------------------------------------------
# specify your base image
FROM python:3

# set a directory for the app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# copy all the files to the container
COPY . .

# install dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# define the port number the container should expose
EXPOSE 5000

# run the command
CMD ["python", "./app.py"]
-----------------------------------------------------

- In the same directory ($ cd docker-curriculum/flask-app), command docker build
(e.g., $ docker build -t mrki102/catnip .)

- See if your image shows
(e.g., $ docker images)

- Run the image and see if it actually works
(e.g., $ docker run -p 8888:5000 mrki102/catnip)

- Open the web page
(e.g., http://localhost:8888/)
(e.g., http://172.17.0.1:8888/)
